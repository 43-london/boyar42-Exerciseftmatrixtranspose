# Exercise

```python
Exercise: ft_matrix_transpose
Allowed functions: malloc, free

• Create a function ft_matrix_transpose that takes a 2D array (matrix) as input and returns its transpose.
• The transpose of a matrix is a new matrix whose rows are the columns of the original matrix.
• The function should allocate memory for the new matrix, fill it with the appropriate values and return it.
• The input matrix should not be modified.
• The function should properly handle the case where the input matrix is not a square matrix (i.e., the number of rows is not equal to the number of columns).
• Here's how it should be prototyped :
int **ft_matrix_transpose(int **matrix, int rows, int columns);
```
